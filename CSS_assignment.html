        <li> What are the benefits of using CSS? </li>
        &#10148;Some of the benefits of using CSS are:
        <ul>
            <li>It makes the website more attractive and user-friendly by applying different styles, colors, fonts, and
                formats to the HTML elements.</li>
            <li>It reduces the amount of code and improves the performance and loading speed of the website by applying
                one style rule to multiple elements or pages.</li>
            <li>It makes the website more consistent and easier to maintain by separating the content from the
                presentation and allowing changes to be made in one place.</li>
            <li>It enhances the accessibility and compatibility of the website by following web standards and allowing
                different devices and browsers to display the website correctly.</li>
        </ul> <!--end-->
        <li>What are the disadvantages of CSS? </li>
        &#10148;<ol>
            <li>CSS can create confusion among web browsers. What works with one browser might not always work with
                another. The web developers need to test for compatibility, running the program across multiple
                browsers.</li>
            <li>There exists a scarcity of security.</li>
            <li>Different levels of CSS i.e. CSS, CSS 2, CSS 3 are often quite confusing.</li>
            <li>Browser compatibility (some styles sheet are supported and some are not).</li>
        </ol><!--end-->
        <li>What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?</li>
        &#10148;
        <ul>
            <li>CSS3 is divided into many different modules, each with its own features and specifications.</li>
            <li>Browser support: CSS3 supports more browsers than CSS2.</li>
            <li>Selectors: CSS3 introduces several new selectors.</li>
            <li>onts: CSS3 allows designers to use special fonts, like those available in Google Fonts and Typecast.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Name a few CSS style components?</li>
        &#10148; <ul>
            <li>Selector: class name, id name or element name that is target</li>
            <li>Attribute: name of the attribute you want to style for example border, color,background, position etc.
            </li>
            <li>Value of Property: value that will be assigned to attribute.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>What do you understand by CSS opacity?</li>
        &#10148;In CSS, opacity is a property that describes the transparency of an element. It's the opposite of
        transparency and represents the degree to which content is hidden behind an element.
        <li>How can the background color of an element be changed?</li>
        &#10148;To change the background color of an element, you can use the CSS background-color property. You can set
        the color name or code you want and place it inside a style attribute. Then add this style attribute to an HTML
        element, like a table, heading, div, or span tag.
        <li>How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?</li>
        &#10148;This task can be achieved by using the background-repeat property that will help us to control the repetition of the image. The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image both horizontally and vertically. It also decides whether the background image will be repeated or not.
        <li>What is the use of the background-position property? </li>
        &#10148;The background-position property in CSS sets the starting position of a background image. It allows you to move a background image (or gradient) around within its container.
        for example:- <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Length values: (e.g. 100px 5px)</li>
            <li>Percentages: (e.g. 100% 5%)</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Which property controls the image scroll in the background?</li>
        &#10148;The background-attachment property in CSS controls the scrolling of an image in the background. This property can be applied to all HTML elements. 
        <li>Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</li>
        &#10148;The background property is a complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.
        <li>How to center block elements using CSS1?</li>
        &#10148;To centrally align the block elements, we can simply make use of the (center) tag. All the elements within the (center) tag will be centrally aligned.
        <li>How to maintain the CSS specifications?</li>
        &#10148;The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
        <li>What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page? </li>
        &#10148;CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML element on the page, use Inline CSS in a style attribute.
        <li>What is embedded style sheets? </li>
        &#10148;Embedded Stylesheet: It allows you to define styles for a particular HTML document as a whole in one place.
        <li>What are the external style sheets? </li>
        &#10148;An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage. 
        <li>What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?</li>
        &#10148;
        <h3>Advantages of CSS:</h3> <br>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>CSS plays an important role, by using CSS you simply got to specify a repeated style for element once & use it multiple times as because CSS will automatically apply the required styles.</li>
            <li>The main advantage of CSS is that style is applied consistently across variety of sites. One instruction can control several areas which is advantageous.</li>
            <li>Web designers needs to use few lines of programming for every page improving site speed.</li>
            <li>Cascading sheet not only simplifies website development, but also simplifies the maintenance as a change of one line of code affects the whole web site and maintenance time.</li>
            <li>It is less complex therefore the effort are significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>It helps to form spontaneous and consistent changes.</li>
        </ol>

            <li>CSS, CSS 1 up to CSS3, result in creating of confusion among  web browsers.</li>
            <li>There exists a scarcity of security.</li>
            <li>With CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with another. The web developers need to test for compatibility, running the program across multiple browsers.</li>
            <li>After making the changes we need to confirm the compatibility if they appear. The similar change affects on all the browsers.</li>
            <li>Browser compatibility (some styles sheet are supported and some are not).</li>
            <li>CSS works differently on different browsers. IE and Opera supports CSS as different logic.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>What is the meaning of the CSS selector? </li>
        &#10148; a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.

            <li>Speech: Used for screenreaders that "reads" the page out loud</li>
            <li>Aural: Intended for speech synthesizers</li>
